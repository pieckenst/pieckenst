## Hi there! üëã

I'm **Andrey Savich**, a passionate developer from **Mogilev, Belarus**. I love creating different projects and software. When it comes to how I work on projects, I don't like to commit changes frequently to GitHub. Instead, I code privately for a couple of hours and then commit the changes.

I don't see the point in committing daily. Besides, nowadays, the number of commits on GitHub can be misleading. Instead, I commit only when the code is ready to work and doesn't crash.

Back in 2021, I used to commit daily. Nowadays, I focus on getting the code to work properly and then push it.

## About Me

Well there's not much to say other than that im a student at Belarusian-Russian University and a software developer and will be one for next 3.5 years

I've Completed Mogilev state polytechnic college in may 2024


Here on this page you can find the projects i worked on and code that may be useful , feel free to grab anything you needCurrently, I'm working on projects that leverage **TypeScript** and **Python** as well as **C#**


Some links below to probably a couple of my decent projects are

https://github.com/pieckenst/Mass-Effect-Legendary-Launcher - Replaces the official electronic arts launcher for mass effect legendary edition- has 1.5k unique downloads on nexus mods and 2.3k total

https://github.com/pieckenst/WebLaunch - pretty much was an attempt at replicating functionality of web based Innova 4game Russian publisher game launcher - which used a custom protocol handler installed on windows pc which is then invoked from web browser and based on web browser selection and logged in state launches a game

## Bat file folk use to inflate commits
```
@echo off

:: Change directory to the specified Git repository

cd "C:\Github staging area\How-to-inflate-your-commits-"



:: Ensure the branch name is correct (replace master with your branch if needed)

SET BRANCH=master



:: Loop to continuously update the files, commit, and push

:loop

    :: Suppress LF to CRLF warnings for this repository

    git config core.autocrlf false



    :: Generate a random line of text and append it to the text file

    echo %RANDOM% >> file.txt



    :: Generate a random Python comment and append it to the Python file

    SET /A rand=%RANDOM% %% 5

    IF %rand%==0 SET COMMENT=# TODO: add error handling

    IF %rand%==1 SET COMMENT=# FIXME: improve performance

    IF %rand%==2 SET COMMENT=# HACK: temporary patch

    IF %rand%==3 SET COMMENT=# REVIEW: check logic flow

    IF %rand%==4 SET COMMENT=# NOTE: optimize later



    echo %COMMENT% >> "file.py"



    :: Stage both files

    git add file.txt

    git add file.py



    :: Commit the changes with a message including the current timestamp

    git commit -m "Update made at %date% %time%"



    :: Push the commit to the correct branch

    git push origin %BRANCH%



    :: Wait for 1 second before the next iteration

    timeout /t 1 >nul

goto loop
```
