## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Andrey Savich**, a passionate developer from **Mogilev, Belarus**. I love creating different projects and software. When it comes to how I work on projects, I don't like to commit changes frequently to GitHub. Instead, I code privately for a couple of hours and then commit the changes.

I don't see the point in committing daily. Besides, nowadays, the number of commits on GitHub can be misleading. Instead, I commit only when the code is ready to work and doesn't crash.

Back in 2021, I used to commit daily. Nowadays, I focus on getting the code to work properly and then push it.
