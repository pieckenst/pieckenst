## Hi there! üëã

I'm **Andrey Savich**, a passionate developer from **Mogilev, Belarus**. I love creating different projects and software. When it comes to how I work on projects, I don't like to commit changes frequently to GitHub. Instead, I code privately for a couple of hours and then commit the changes.

I don't see the point in committing daily. Besides, nowadays, the number of commits on GitHub can be misleading. Instead, I commit only when the code is ready to work and doesn't crash.

Back in 2021, I used to commit daily. Nowadays, I focus on getting the code to work properly and then push it.

## About Me

Well, there's not much to say other than that I am a student at the Belarusian-Russian University and a software developer. I will be a student there for the next 3.5 years.

I graduated from Mogilev State Polytechnical College in May 2024.

On this page, you can find the projects I worked on and the code that might be useful. Feel free to use anything you need. Currently, I am working on projects that use **TypeScript**, **Python**, and **C#**.

Here are some links to probably a couple of my decent projects:

1. [Mass-Effect-Legendary-Launcher](https://github.com/pieckenst/Mass-Effect-Legendary-Launcher) ‚Äî Replaces the official Electronic Arts launcher for the Mass Effect Legendary Edition. It has 1.5k unique downloads on Nexus Mods and 2.3k total.

2. [WebLaunch](https://github.com/pieckenst/WebLaunch) ‚Äî This was an attempt to replicate the functionality of the web-based Innova 4game Russian publisher game launcher. It uses a custom protocol handler installed on a Windows PC, which is then invoked from a web browser. Based on the web browser selection and logged in state, it launches a game.
